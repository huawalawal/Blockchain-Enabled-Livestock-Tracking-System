# Blockchain-Enabled Livestock Tracking

A decentralized solution for transparent, secure, and efficient management of livestock throughout the entire supply chain.

## Overview

This blockchain platform revolutionizes livestock management by creating an immutable, transparent record of animals from birth to market. By digitizing animal identification, health records, feed information, and ownership transfers, the system enables unprecedented traceability, improves food safety, enhances disease control, and builds consumer trust in the meat and dairy industries.

### 4. Ownership Transfer Contract

This contract manages the secure transfer of animal ownership throughout the supply chain, maintaining continuous chain of custody.

**Key Features:**
- Secure ownership transfer with multi-party verification
- Transport documentation and conditions monitoring
- Market and auction integration
- Price and transaction record keeping
- Automated regulatory compliance checks before transfer
- Export/import documentation for international movement
- Slaughterhouse and processor handoff verification
